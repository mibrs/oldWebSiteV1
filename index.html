    <p>This website demonstrates some html coding of projects I did during the year long extracurricular activity 
      "Creative Coding" in 2021/21. I hope you enjoy the artifacts, it was fun to try new things out.</p>

    <p class="focus">During the year we did the following projects:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>About me</li>
      <li>Examples for Arcade Games</li>
      <li>A game with P5JS</li>
      <li>Audio processing with Audacity and MAX 8</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>On the topic of audio and multimedia processing, we used Audacity and MAX 8. It was the first time in incorporated these two tooks
    into my curriculum.</p>

    <p>Michael's Audio Recording comes next.</p>
    
    <h2>My first audio recording</h2>
    
    <p>This is a short audio clip done using the Ableton Learning Music website, recorded with Audacity.
    Its duration was cut down to 5 seconds. Furthermore, I have fade in and fade out have been added with Audacity.
    The whole process is also described in a small YouTube video, look out for it.</p>
    
    <div>
    <audio controls>
      <source src="images/testedit.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    </audio>
    </div>

    <p>The idea here was to show you how to incorporate audio clipos into your website, it only requires a few lines of HTML.
