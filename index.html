    <p>This website demonstrates some html coding of projects I did during the year long extracurricular activity 
      "Creative Coding" in 2021/21. I hope you enjoy the artifacts, it was fun to try new things out.</p>

    <p class="focus">During the year we did the following projects:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>About me</li>
      <li>Examples for Arcade Games</li>
      <li>A game with P5JS</li>
      <li>Audio processing with Audacity and MAX 8</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>On the topic of audio and multimedia processing, we used Audacity and MAX 8. It was the first time these tools have been
    incorporated into my curriculum. It just adds another dimension into creative coding!</p>

    <p>Here is the screenshot of the first MAX8 project: A audio player!</p>

    <p>Michael's Audio Recording comes next.</p>
    
    <h2>My first audio recording</h2>
    
    <p>This is a short audio clip done using the Ableton Learning Music website, recorded with Audacity.
    Its duration was reduced to 5 seconds. Furthermore, I have faded in and faded out at the start respective end.
    The whole process is also described in a short YouTube video, look out for it.</p>
    
    <div>
    <audio controls>
      <source src="images/testedit.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    </audio>
    </div>

    <p>The idea here was to show you how to incorporate audio clipos into your website, it only requires a few lines of HTML.
